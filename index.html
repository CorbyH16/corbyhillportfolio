I'm currently studying Digital Media at the University of the West of England and this is my portfolio website which demonstrates a range of my abilities, including but not limited to  3D Modelling, Graphic and Web Design, 2D Animation and Creative Coding.</div>

  <div class="row g-5">
    <div class="col col-left">During this semester, I have learnt a huge amount of information relating to coding and web development. I have faced many challenges during the process of hosting my own portfolio website, which have been resolved through either reflecting back on previous lectures, asking for assistance from lecturers or online research such as W3 Schools and the productive use of AI. I have not used any copied and pasted code straight from AI, I have only used it to help me understand what lines of code do and then used that information to adapt them into my own work independently. <br></br>I began by creating an overall concept within Figma, which gave me a strong visual direction of what I was creating. I did research on multiple professional portfolios through the Wall of Portfolios website, which lets you see a range of artists and how they have displayed their own portfolios. I leaned more towards a modern, minimalist style, as I believe this looks the most professional and makes your artwork the most standout imagery on the page. I also went with a central and greyscale theme, which tends to make the page feel less cluttered and allows my artwork to be the most memorable part of the viewing experience. <br></br>During the development process, I faced a few challenges. For example, positioning my text as I planned. Understanding the use of justifying text, adding margins, padding, alignment and flex boxes helped me with this drastically. The majority of this was covered within lectures, and the rest I figured out by researching with W3 Schools. Another was the creation of navigation bars using bootstrap, which allowed my menu to be interactive and would take you to my other pages. This I found to be difficult to get my head around, however research using ChatGPT helped me with this a lot, it was able to show me examples of how to adapt navigation within my code and explained to me how I would need to create a html file within my GitHub repository for each of my pages, with the initial index.html displaying my opening page. Using this information, I successfully managed to create a working nav bar. However, my biggest challenge by far was making sure the website worked with mobile, it's been very difficult as I initially used alot of margin-top and margin-left for example. I used AI to explain this to me and I gave it my code for a better explanation. It prompted me to remove many things as this effected the layout on mobile, whilst also helping me use @media alongside min and max width so the code can adjust according to the screenwidth. This helped me alot and I managed to improve my mobile version drastically, although it's not perfect. I also worked with it to help me understand the correct bootstrap terminology to implement into my work, again helping the grid fit in the mobile view.   <br></br>There have been a few changes going from my Figma design to my outcome, such as dropping the home page, as it was unnecessary to have both a home page as well as an about me page. Furthermore, I also changed from a masonry-style grid to a plain 3-column grid. The masonry style was quite a technical challenge for me, and in my opinion, it did not look as professional as a standard grid, as this kept each row in line and gave it a more effective flow.<br></br>In conclusion, I have really enjoyed this process as I have very minimal experience with coding, and to host and develop my own website exactly how I planned, with subtle differences, is hugely rewarding. I am looking forward to adding responsive elements next semester. </div>
